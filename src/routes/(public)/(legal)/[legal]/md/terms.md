BUILTSEARCH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE BUILTSEARCH SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE BUILTSEARCH SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.

## DISPUTES

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any BuiltSearch Service, or to any products or services posted through BuiltSearch.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to BuiltSearch PWK Holdings Private Limited, Attn: Legal Department, 22 Sin Ming Lane #06-76 Midview City Singapore 573969.

The arbitration will be conducted by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (the "SIAC") in accordance with its Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of your request (the "Rules"). The Rules are available at http://www.siac.org.sg/our-rules. To the extent of any inconsistency or conflict between the Rules and the provisions in these Terms of use, the Terms of use will prevail.

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Rules. BuiltSearch will reimburse those fees for claims totalling less than S$10,000 unless the tribunal determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, BuiltSearch will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the tribunal determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitration will take place in Singapore, and the language of arbitration shall be English.

The arbitral tribunal shall comprise one arbitrator nominated jointly by BuiltSearch and you, or failing such joint nomination, by the President of the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC. Any decision or award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the parties.

The parties agree to waive (to the fullest extent permitted by law) any right of application or appeal to any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction in connection with any question of fact or law arising in the course of any arbitration or from any arbitral award or order.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of use, we both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

## APPLICABLE LAW

By using any BuiltSearch Service, you agree that the laws of Singapore, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and BuiltSearch.

## Changes to Terms

- We may update these Terms from time to time.
- Your continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms.
